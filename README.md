**Local Voice Quality Enhancement** — a compact neural model for joint
acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), noise suppression, and dereverberation of
16 kHz speech, designed to run on commodity CPUs in real time.

- Two sizes — choose by CPU budget:
  - **v1.3 (current)** — 4.8 M parameters (~19 MB F32), ~3.3 ms per 16 ms
    frame on Zen4 (4 threads), **≈4.7× realtime**.
  - **v1.2** — 1.3 M parameters (~5 MB F32), ~1.6 ms per 16 ms frame on
    Zen4 (4 threads), **≈9.7× realtime**.
- Causal, streaming: 256-sample hop, 16 ms algorithmic latency
- F32 reference inference in C++ via [GGML](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml);
  PyTorch reference included for verification and research

LocalVQE is a derivative of **DeepVQE**
([Indenbom et al., Interspeech 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03177)) —
smaller, GGML-native, and tuned for streaming CPU inference. The
architecture is documented in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md);
this README covers building and running the published weights only.

## A concrete example

Picture a video call from a laptop. Your microphone picks up three things
alongside your voice:

1. The remote participant's voice, played back through your speakers and
   caught again by your mic — this is the **echo**. Without cancellation
   they hear themselves a fraction of a second later.
2. Your own voice bouncing off walls, desk, and monitor before reaching
   the mic — this is **reverberation**, the "tunnel" or "bathroom" sound
   that makes you feel far away from the listener.
3. A fan, keyboard clatter, a dog barking, or traffic outside — plain
   **background noise**.

LocalVQE removes all three in a single causal pass, frame by frame, on
the CPU, so only your voice reaches the far end.

## Why this, and not a classical AEC/NS stack?

Hand-tuned DSP pipelines (NLMS/AP/Kalman AEC, Wiener/spectral-subtraction
NS, MCRA noise tracking, RLS dereverb) can run in tens of microseconds per
frame and remain a strong baseline when the acoustic path is benign. LocalVQE
is interesting when you want:

- **Robustness to non-linear echo paths** (small loudspeakers, handheld
  devices, plastic laptop chassis) where linear AEC leaves residual echo.
- **Non-stationary noise suppression** (babble, keyboards, fans changing
  speed) that energy-based noise estimators struggle with.
- **One model, many conditions** — no per-device tuning of step sizes,
  forgetting factors, or VAD thresholds.
- **A single deterministic causal pass** — no double-talk detector, no
  adaptation state that can diverge.

The trade-off is CPU: a classical stack might cost ~0.1 ms/frame, LocalVQE
~1–2 ms/frame. On anything larger than a microcontroller that's still a
small fraction of a real-time budget.

## Why this, and not DeepVQE?

Microsoft never released DeepVQE — no weights, no reference
implementation, no streaming runtime. We re-implemented it from the
paper as a GGML graph at
[richiejp/deepvqe-ggml](https://github.com/richiejp/deepvqe-ggml)
(the full-width ~7.5 M-parameter version) before starting LocalVQE.
LocalVQE is the same idea rebuilt for streaming CPU inference, and
published in two sizes: a 1.3 M-parameter compact build (v1.2, ~5 MB
F32) for tight CPU budgets, and a 4.8 M-parameter wider build (v1.3,
~19 MB F32) that filters noise better on some clips at ~2× the
per-hop cost. Both are small enough to run real time on commodity
CPUs.

## Model Weights

Pre-trained weights are published on Hugging Face at
[LocalAI-io/LocalVQE](https://huggingface.co/LocalAI-io/LocalVQE):

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `localvqe-v1.3-4.8M-f32.gguf` | F32 GGUF — what the C++ engine loads (current default). |
| `localvqe-v1.3-4.8M.pt` | PyTorch checkpoint — for verification, ablation, and downstream research. |
| `localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-f32.gguf` | Compact alternative — same architecture family, ~1/4 the cost per hop. |
| `localvqe-v1.2-1.3M.pt` | PyTorch checkpoint for the compact variant. |
| `localvqe-v1.1-1.3M-f32.gguf` | Older release. |
| `localvqe-v1-1.3M-f32.gguf` | Original release. |

The current release is **v1.3**. It widens the encoder/decoder
(mic channels `[2,112,32,104,96,152]`, far `[2,64,32]`, bottleneck
256) and trains from scratch under a noise-floor-aware loss recipe.
On doubletalk it filters noise better than v1.2 (deg MOS +0.25 on
the stratified dev sample, with stronger ERLE). On far-end-only
echo it cancels harder but the residual rates rougher in AECMOS —
some users will prefer v1.2's gentler trade-off on FE-ST scenes.
v1.2 stays on the repo as the small/fast option (~1/4 the per-hop
cost). Both reuse v1.2's 1024 ms echo-search window.

## Streaming latency

Per-hop, 16 kHz / 256-sample hop → 16 ms budget. Each hop is a full
`ggml_backend_graph_compute`. Run any of these locally with the
`bench-run` cmake target — see [Benchmark](#benchmark) below. 30
iters × 625 hops/iter = 18 750 hops per row.

### v1.3 (current — 4.8 M, wider encoder/decoder, bn 256)

| Hardware                              | Backend | Threads | Hop p50  | Hop p99  | RT factor |
|---------------------------------------|---------|--------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|
| Ryzen 9 7900 (Zen4 desktop)           | CPU     |       1 |  9.73 ms | 14.48 ms |     1.58× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 (Zen4 desktop)           | CPU     |       2 |  5.41 ms |  5.62 ms |     2.95× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 (Zen4 desktop)           | CPU     |       4 |  3.21 ms |  3.42 ms |     4.97× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 (Zen4 desktop)           | CPU     |       8 |  3.47 ms |  3.80 ms |     4.59× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 (Zen4 desktop)           | CPU     |      16 |  3.79 ms |  4.06 ms |     4.19× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 + RADV iGPU (Raphael)    | Vulkan  |       — |  8.71 ms |  9.15 ms |     1.83× |
| Ryzen 9 7900 + RTX 5070 Ti (dGPU)     | Vulkan  |       — |  2.57 ms |  4.21 ms |     6.07× |

The wider model is ~2× the per-hop cost of v1.2 in matching
configurations — the dGPU (RTX 5070 Ti) ends up the fastest option
for v1.3 by ~1.25× vs 4-thread CPU. The 1-thread case is the
worst, still real-time (RT 1.58×) but with little margin; running
v1.3 on a low-core / power-constrained device should use v1.2
instead. Re-runs on other CPUs (Apple M4, Alder Lake, mobile Zen3+)
will be published as we collect them — until then the v1.2 sweep
below is representative shape-wise and expects roughly the same ~2×
multiplier.

### v1.2 (compact alternative — 1.3 M, 1024 ms echo-search window)

| Hardware                              | Backend | Threads | Hop p50  | Hop p99  | Hop max    | RT factor |

| Ryzen 7 6800U (Zen3+ laptop)          | CPU     |       1 |  4.69 ms |  6.08 ms | 19.31 ms ‡ |     3.37× |

| Ryzen 7 6800U (Zen3+ laptop)          | CPU     |       8 |  1.94 ms |  2.60 ms |  5.52 ms   |     7.94× |
| Ryzen 7 6800U + RADV iGPU (Rembrandt) | Vulkan  |       — |  9.84 ms | 14.75 ms | 20.87 ms ‡ |     1.53× |

The wider echo-search window v1.2 introduced (1024 ms vs v1.1's 512 ms)
costs ~20–25 % per-hop on CPU vs v1.1.

Adding cores hits diminishing returns quickly: even the wider v1.3
graph is small enough that thread-launch and synchronisation
overhead start to dominate beyond ≈4 threads on these CPUs. The
Zen4 sweeps show it plainly on both versions — the 1→4 thread step
gives a 2.59× speedup on v1.2 and a 3.03× speedup on v1.3, but
4→8 is a regression on both and 8→16 worse still. The 6800U mobile
Zen3+ on v1.2 agrees: 1→4 is a 2.21× speedup, 4→8 only buys another
7%. **The library's default thread count is `min(4, sched_getaffinity)`** —
auto-capped at 4 with respect for `taskset`, cgroup, and VM CPU
limits, so over-subscription doesn't happen on resource-constrained
hosts. Pass a non-zero value to `localvqe_options_set_threads` to
override.

‡ Outliers are single hops early in the first iteration (cold
caches); p99 is representative of steady-state.

Vulkan p50/p95/p99 are typically tight, but worst-case single-hop
latency on a shared desktop is sensitive to external GPU clients
(display compositor, browser). On a dedicated embedded device with
no compositor contending for the queue, expect the quieter end of
the range.

The bench binary prints the top-10 slowest hops with
`(iteration, hop-in-iteration)` coordinates so you can check whether
outliers cluster at post-`localvqe_reset()` boundaries (cold path)
or scatter through the stream (external contention). In practice we
see the latter.

### Memory footprint (CPU)

`bench` reports process RSS from `/proc/self/status` alongside the
internal allocator accounting from `--profile`. The numbers are
essentially thread-count-invariant — both 1 and 16 threads land on
the same peak within a few hundred KiB — so one row per model
suffices.

| Model            | Post-load delta ¹ | Peak RSS (VmHWM) ² | Internal `total resident` ³ |
|------------------|------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------------:|
| **v1.3** (4.8 M) | +24.4 MiB         |  34.1 MiB          |  23.0 MiB                   |
| **v1.2** (1.3 M) | +10.0 MiB         |  19.6 MiB          |   8.7 MiB                   |

¹ RSS added by `localvqe_new_with_options` + CPU backend init, on
top of the ~7 MiB binary/libs baseline measured by `bench` itself.
This is the portable "working set the model brings" number; the
absolute peak will depend on your host process baseline.

² `VmHWM` after warmup + sustained streaming on a Zen4 desktop
(Ryzen 9 7900). v1.3 is ~1.75× v1.2 in RSS terms despite carrying
~3.7× more parameters — activation, history-scratch, and per-frame
history buffers don't scale with channel width the way the weight
buffer does.

³ Backend-internal accounting from `bench --profile`: the sum of
the weights buffer, activation buffer (gallocr), and one-shot
history scratch. Excludes the double-buffered history-tensor swap
pages (already counted in the activation buffer for the read side).

For GPU backends (Vulkan), RSS understates real usage — VRAM isn't
visible in `/proc/self/status`. Use `bench --profile` on the GPU
build to read the same weights/activation/scratch breakdown from
the backend-internal allocator.

v1.3 vs v1.2 deltas (same 800-clip set, same eval pipeline):

- **Doubletalk deg MOS +0.25**, dt-with-movement deg MOS +0.13 —
  the wider model + noise-floor-aware loss recipe noticeably reduces
  perceived speech degradation when both talkers are active. The
  primary v1.3 release goal.
- **FE-ST-with-movement ERLE +9.3 dB**, FE-ST ERLE +5.2 dB — v1.3
  cancels far-end echo substantially harder. AECMOS echo MOS drops
  −0.24 / −0.09 at the same time: the residual after cancellation
  rates rougher on AECMOS's perceptual scale even though there's
  numerically less of it. Some users will prefer v1.2's gentler
  trade-off on far-end-only scenes.
- **Nearend-singletalk identical** within noise (deg +0.02,
  OVRL +0.00) — wider capacity doesn't help (or hurt) when there's
  nothing to cancel.
- DNSMOS OVRL is up 0.04–0.21 across all scenarios — the wider
  model produces consistently cleaner-rated output by DNS metrics.

For the original v1.2-vs-v1.1 release notes (the previous headline:
echo MOS +0.80 / +0.72 on FE-ST and FE-ST-with-movement, near-end
deg MOS +0.11), see the v1.2 git tag.

- **AECMOS** (Purin et al., ICASSP 2022) is Microsoft's non-intrusive AEC
  quality predictor. "Echo" rates how well echo was removed; "degradation"
  rates how clean the resulting speech is. 1–5 MOS scale, higher is better.
- **Blind ERLE** is `10·log10(E[mic²] / E[enh²])`. Only meaningful on
  far-end single-talk where the input is echo-only; on scenes with active
  near-end speech it understates echo removal because both numerator and
  denominator are dominated by speech.

## Building the C++ Inference Engine

Requires CMake ≥ 3.20 and a C++17 compiler. A [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
flake is provided:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/localai-org/LocalVQE.git
cd LocalVQE

# With Nix:
nix develop
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ggml/build -j$(nproc)

# Without Nix — install cmake, gcc/clang, pkg-config, libsndfile, then:
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ggml/build -j$(nproc)
```

Binaries land in `ggml/build/bin/`. The CPU build produces multiple
`libggml-cpu-*.so` variants (SSE4.2 / AVX2 / AVX-512) selected at runtime.
Keep the binaries and `.so` files together.

### Vulkan backend (embedded / integrated-GPU targets)

Add `-DLOCALVQE_VULKAN=ON` to the configure step. This composes with the
CPU build — an additional `libggml-vulkan.so` is produced in
`ggml/build/bin/` and the runtime loader picks it up when a Vulkan ICD is
present, otherwise it falls back to the CPU variants.

```bash
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLOCALVQE_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build ggml/build -j$(nproc)
```

The Nix flake's dev shell already includes `vulkan-loader`,
`vulkan-headers`, and `shaderc`. Without Nix, install the equivalents
from your distro (Debian: `libvulkan-dev vulkan-headers
glslc`/`shaderc`).

## Running Inference

### CLI

```bash
./ggml/build/bin/localvqe localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-f32.gguf \
    --in-wav mic.wav ref.wav \
    --out-wav enhanced.wav
```

Expects 16 kHz mono PCM for both mic and far-end reference.

### Benchmark

The `bench-run` cmake target is the turnkey path: it builds `bench`,
downloads the released F32 model and a doubletalk mic/ref WAV pair from
HuggingFace into `ggml/build/bench_assets/`, and runs the benchmark.

```bash
# Configure once (Vulkan optional but recommended for GPU runs)
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLOCALVQE_VULKAN=ON

# Discover backends + device indices
cmake --build ggml/build --target bench-list-devices

# Run on the default backend (CPU device 0, 10 iterations)
cmake --build ggml/build --target bench-run
```

To pick a specific backend or device, set the cache variables at
configure time and rebuild the target:

```bash
# Vulkan device 0 (e.g. dGPU) with 30 iterations
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DBENCH_BACKEND=Vulkan -DBENCH_DEVICE=0 -DBENCH_ITERS=30
cmake --build ggml/build --target bench-run

# Vulkan device 1 (e.g. iGPU)
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DBENCH_DEVICE=1
cmake --build ggml/build --target bench-run
```

Sweeping every backend/device on the box is just a shell loop over the
indices `bench-list-devices` printed:

```bash
for dev in 0 1; do
    cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DBENCH_BACKEND=Vulkan -DBENCH_DEVICE=$dev
    cmake --build ggml/build --target bench-run
done
```

Or invoke the binary directly against your own WAV pair:

```bash
./ggml/build/bin/bench localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-f32.gguf \
    --backend Vulkan --device 0 \
    --in-wav mic.wav ref.wav --iters 10 --profile
```

### Shared Library (C API)

```bash
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DLOCALVQE_BUILD_SHARED=ON
cmake --build ggml/build -j$(nproc)
```

Produces `liblocalvqe.so` with the API in `ggml/localvqe_api.h`. See
`ggml/example_purego_test.go` for a Go / `purego` integration.

### Regression test

`ggml/tests/test_regression.cpp` is an end-to-end check: it runs
`localvqe_process_f32` on a fixed seeded input through each published
`.gguf` and compares against a committed reference output, mirroring
the PyTorch suite under `pytorch/tests/`. Build, fetch both released
GGUFs from HuggingFace, and run via CTest:

```bash
cmake --build ggml/build --target test_regression regression-assets
ctest --test-dir ggml/build --output-on-failure
```

`regression-assets` reuses the same SHA256-verified download path as
`bench-assets`. Missing GGUFs make the corresponding test entry SKIP
rather than fail, so CI without network access still runs cleanly.

To refresh a reference output after an intentional graph change:

```bash
python ggml/tests/regenerate_fixtures.py \
    --gguf ggml/build/bench_assets/localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-f32.gguf
```

### Quantizing (experimental)

Calibrated Q4_K / Q8_0 weights are not yet published. The `quantize`
tool in the C++ build can produce GGUF variants from the F32 reference
for experimentation:

```bash
./ggml/build/bin/quantize localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-f32.gguf localvqe-v1.2-1.3M-q8.gguf Q8_0
```

Expect end-to-end quality loss until proper per-tensor selection and
calibration have been worked through.

## OBS Studio Plugin

`obs-plugin/` wraps `liblocalvqe.so` as an OBS Studio audio source
filter. Once installed it appears as **"LocalVQE (AEC + Noise +
Dereverb)"** in any audio source's filter list. The bundled v1.3 GGUF
is preselected on first use, so noise suppression and dereverberation
work out of the box; AEC additionally requires picking a reference
source — typically "Desktop Audio" — so the model knows what's
playing through the speakers.

The flake provides a dedicated dev shell with libobs alongside the
parent build deps:

```bash
nix develop .#obs-plugin

# Parent library (shared); the plugin links against it.
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLOCALVQE_BUILD_SHARED=ON
cmake --build ggml/build -j$(nproc)

# Stage the bundled GGUF so the plugin's default-model resolver finds it.
cmake --build ggml/build --target regression-assets
cp ggml/build/bench_assets/localvqe-v1.3-4.8M-f32.gguf obs-plugin/data/

# Plugin
cmake -S obs-plugin -B obs-plugin/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build obs-plugin/build -j$(nproc)
cmake --install obs-plugin/build
```

The install copies the plugin `.so` along with `liblocalvqe.so` and
every `libggml-cpu-*.so` variant into
`~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvqe/`, so the tree is
self-contained — no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, no system-wide install of
LocalVQE required. Pass
`-DOBS_PLUGIN_DESTINATION=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins/obs-localvqe`
to the plugin's configure step for a system-wide install instead.

Restart OBS, right-click any audio source → Filters → Add → **LocalVQE**.

| Property              | Default | Notes                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model (.gguf)         | bundled | Auto-resolved to `data/localvqe-v1.3-4.8M-f32.gguf` if staged; otherwise browse to a path.        |
| Inference threads     | 4       | Sweet spot on Zen4 (see the benchmark table). Changing this rebuilds the model ctx.               |
| Residual noise gate   | off     | Mutes hops below an RMS threshold; cleans up quiet model residual during silence.                 |
| Gate threshold (dBFS) | -45     | Only used when the gate is on. -45 mutes the typical -60 dBFS residual but preserves speech.      |
| Reference source      | (none)  | For AEC: pick the OBS source feeding your speakers (usually "Desktop Audio"). Off → NS + dereverb only. |

Without a reference, the AEC head sees silence and contributes nothing
— the filter still runs noise suppression and dereverberation on the
mic alone. With a reference, the plugin time-aligns it to the mic
queue via OBS timestamps; the model's AlignBlock then absorbs the
remaining speaker→mic acoustic delay (up to ~1 s on v1.2 and v1.3).

Tested on Linux. macOS uses the same POSIX `dladdr` path and is
expected to work unchanged. The Windows path is implemented (via
`GetModuleHandleEx` + `GetModuleFileName` in `ensure_backends_loaded`)
but is currently unverified — please open an issue if you hit a
problem there.

## PyTorch Reference

`pytorch/` contains the model definition used to train and export the
weights. It's provided for verification, ablation, and downstream research
— not for end-user inference, which should go through the GGML build.

```bash
cd pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "
import yaml, torch
from localvqe.model import LocalVQE
cfg = yaml.safe_load(open('configs/default.yaml'))
model = LocalVQE(**cfg['model'], n_freqs=cfg['audio']['n_freqs'])
print(sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()))
"
```

## Dataset Attribution

Published weights are trained on data from the
[ICASSP 2023 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge)
(Microsoft, CC BY 4.0) and fine-tuned on the
[ICASSP 2022/2023 Acoustic Echo Cancellation Challenge](https://github.com/microsoft/AEC-Challenge).

## Safety Note

Training data was filtered by DNSMOS perceived-quality scores, which can
misclassify distressed speech (screaming, crying) as noise. LocalVQE may
attenuate or distort such signals and must not be relied upon for emergency
call or safety-critical applications.
